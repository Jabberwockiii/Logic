我的道德经英文翻译：
道就是Rationality
道可道，非常道。
Rationality can be spoken, but it cannot always be spoken(Wittgenstein, private language)
名可名，非常名
Notation can be notated, but the notation will confused you. 
无名，天地之始，有名，万物之母。
When you start your formal proof, there is no assumption. we should be skeptical. When you start your formal proof with notation, then every logical reasoning can be started. 
故常无欲，以观其妙
Thus, we should not have an assumption and a prior(by Kant) knowledge.
常有欲，以观其徼。
Thus, when we are proofing with our assumption, we should observe its mathematical algebraic structure first, then proof it later. 
此两者同出而异名，同谓之玄。玄之又玄，众妙之门。
With assumption and without assumption, it's just a different notation. Predicate Logic of the ambiguity of different notation. This is Philosophy(玄)。 The philosophy of philosophy (Metaphilosophy), it is the beginning of all subjects(math, physcis, biology, chemistry, politics, history, and more)
