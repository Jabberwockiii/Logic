10:00 start work on logic 

Cantor theorem 

how to proof?
target and relevance 
make it alive logic!

Framework provides a goal

45 minutes: 
read through the guide 

5, 3, 4 size tank 
5, 3 = 8 amount of water

25 logic 
26 dis-sys

8:25 start 
closure,
arithmetic proof 

10:00 closure

proof by induction 
one dirction: N ->
two direction: n <=> m
base case: basic includes 0
inductive step: 
1. one extra: suc(n)
2. suppose: origianl proof(available)
    2a. can be multiple supposition case, we use the supposition directly!!!
3. target: suc(n) substitute n in OP

operation: multi paramerter of Cartesian product function

11:00 read trac 
shading allow dup or not 

Kill that process, right?
11-11:30 read some zhihu shit 
read no more 
11 : 30 
planning, 2 hours later eat lunch, light
11 : 40 
tomorrow: prepare question 4 hours sys
logic 4 hours
