10:00 closure

proof by induction 
one dirction: N ->
two direction: n <=> m
base case: basic includes 0
inductive step: 
1. one extra: suc(n)
2. suppose: origianl proof(available)
    2a. can be multiple supposition case, we use the supposition directly!!!
3. target: suc(n) substitute n in OP

operation: multi paramerter of Cartesian product function
