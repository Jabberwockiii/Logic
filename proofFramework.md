Let's stay on the same page for understanding what "proof" actually means in the set theory and in mathmatics and natural science and social science so that we can applied it everywhere in our daily life. 
Assumption 1 : my proof is consistent with the proof framework of [stanford](https://anvilproject.org/guides/content/creating-links)

Assumption 2: my proof should have some structure. This term structure should be consistent with the term structure in the field of universal algebra. 

Assumption 3: All the axioms can be broken down to the structure such like "if then" and "if and only if" statement. 

Assumption 4: the if then statments can constitute a Graph(by definition of CS, data structure). The Graph can be interpreted multiple ways but uses set theory to make it formal.
